maybe not so important? As the ceasefire extended outside the coding period, many variables have gotten -1 for ""unclear/missing"". 

Implement: The cease-fire will be verified by a joint mechanism made up of Colombian security forces, ELN members, the UN and the Catholic Church, according to a joint statement by the government and the guerrilla. Agencia CMA( 29.09.2017). Colombia: Government and ELN urge UN to verify ceasefire. 
- During the temporary end to hostilities, announced during Pope Francis's visit to Colombia, kidnappings and attacks on oil infrastructure are to stop and be monitored by a UN body as well as the government, rebels and church.

Since I'm not sure exactly when the previous ceasefire ended I'm setting the date to the day when the revised agreement was signed (Acuerdo final, 24.11.16; UN Security Council, 15.12.16).

Enforcement:
The enforcement mechanism is a trepartite cooperation between UN unarmed observers, FARC-EP and the Colombian government.

The ceasefire part of the peace agreement was reached on the 22nd and signed the 23rd of june 2016 (Nicholas Casey, 22.06.2016). However this first agreement wouldn't actually begin unless there was a conclusion on the final peace agreement. Therefore I've set the declaration date to the actual order to cease fire, and the effect date to when it was set to start (see evidence_onset).

Link, link_ID:
Follow-up on the unilateral truce by FARC from 2015

Enforcement:
The enforcement mechanism is a trepartite cooperation between UN unarmed observers, FARC-EP and the Colombian government.

Ended/end date:
I set the 2nd of october as the end date because the no-vote of the referendum officially made it invalid. However, none of the codes in the variable ""ended"" captures this.
